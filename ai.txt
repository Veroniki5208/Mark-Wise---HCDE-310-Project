How I used AI in this project:

I asked AI on how to hide the client id and client secret from github.
It gave me instructions and I followed the instructions by adding the .env file
to .gitignore. It also helped me load the client id and secret and use it in my markwise file
using dotenv. It also gave me how to integrate the spotify token into my code. I copy and
pasted the get_spotify_token method from ai.

Other than that, I did not use ai for this project.
